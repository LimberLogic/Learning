Hello everyone, 

This is the Limber Logic Learning code repository. 

Here, we will host all code used and created in our Limber Logic Learning sessions 
at https://livecoding.tv/anthonycargile/

These changes will be tracked by commit so you can go back to any point in time to 
get a particular snapshot of code. 

Please refer to Github's Git guide(s) for help setting up a Git client to take full
advantage of Git's capabilities: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

This repository is completely public domain in license and will continually grow
as the Limber Logic Learning classes progress. 

Thanks for taking interest and feel free to join the fun!
